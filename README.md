This single page application displays a map of Chicago downtown, containing markers showing popular park and museum locations. It provides filter functionality, allowing users to switch between viewing all markers, parks or museums only. The search function narrows down displayed markers by allowing user to search by either full or partial attraction names.  User could either use search OR filter option.  Using either option clears out the other feature selection.  The list feature displays chosen popular destinations, clicking on which would display a short detail info from wiki, as well as a link to the corresponding article on the Wikipedia page.
 In order to run the application, please download all the files maintaining the structure and open index.html page in Firefox.
